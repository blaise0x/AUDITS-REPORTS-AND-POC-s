# 🔒 Audit Reports & Exploit PoCs

Welcome to my vault of smart contract secrets 🔑  
I’m Blaise, a security researcher who lives at the intersection of **Ethereum, DeFi, and Zero-Day hunting**.  
Here, I dissect protocols, expose vulnerabilities, and build battle-tested Proof of Concepts (PoCs) that show how things break and how to fix them.

## 🚀 What’s inside this repo?

### 📜 Audit Reports
Deep dives into Smart contracts where I reveal **hidden flaws, gas pitfalls, and critical vulnerabilities**.  
Think of it as X-ray vision for DeFi protocols.

### 🧨 Proof of Concepts (PoCs)
Not just theory **live, breathing examples of exploits**.  
These are the scars of the blockchain battlefield, showing *exactly* how attacks unfold.  
If you’re building, these will help you bulletproof your contracts.  
If you’re learning, they’re your shortcut into the hacker’s mind.
